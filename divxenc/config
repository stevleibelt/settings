############## Configuration file for divxenc ##############
#
# Version: 21 - do not modify or remove this line !!!
#
# This file is used by the divxenc script and contains the
# paths to the programs needed for its correct operation.
# The user can use it to modify the path to the various programs
# in case one or more of these programs is not in a standard location
# and connot be found by the system. It can also be used in
# case the user has multiple executables of the same program but
# wants to use a specific executable for the job.
# Note that this file cannot be used to store encoding settings
# or other parameters! They will be ignored. Everything after
# a # sign is a comment.
#
# The EDITOR variable is used to set the preferred text editor for
# editing the config file through the terminal. It defaults to the
# nano text editor.
#
# The ALLOW_* variables can be used to enable or disable specific
# audio/video filters and containers. Setting a variable to 'n' will
# skip asking questions about the specific filter/container.
#
# The DEFAULT_VID_BITRATE, DEFAULT_VID_QTZR and DEFAULT_AUD_CODEC are
# self-explanatory. The first one sets the default bitrate, the second
# one the default Quantizer value and the last one allows you to set
# the default audio codec.
#
# The DEFAULT_OUTPUT variable can be used to provide a custom output directory
# for your encodes. If left empty, divxenc defaults to your home
# directory for output. If set, divxenc checks for it and will create
# the directory if it's not present. The DEFAULT_OUTPUT variable can be
# overwritten on the command line, meaning that if it's set but the
# user provides a path on the command line, that path will be used
# instead.
#
# The TEMPDIR variable below can be used to change the location
# of the temporary directory used by divxenc. If unset, divxenc
# will default to /home/username/.divxenc/job<PID>
# If used, you must provide the full path to a directory. If the
# directory is missing, divxenc will create it.
#
# The MPLAYEROPTS variable can be used to set other mplayer options.
# Be careful which options you use as they may introduce problems
# when using the script.
#
# The PRIORITY variable is used to set a 'nice' value for the encoding
# process. The values one can use are between -20 and 19 where -20
# will give the highest possible priority and 19 the least favorable
# one. Please note that only root can set/use a negative nice value.
# Regular users can only use/set values 0 to 19. If the variable is
# empty, then the default nice value of 0 is used. If the variable
# contains a negative value but the script is ran with normal user
# privileges, divxenc will print a notice and exit.
#
# The DVD_DEVICE and CDROM_DEVICE variables can be used to specify a
# preferred device to encode from. Note that only block devices are
# supported in these variables. CDROM_DEVICE is used for (S)VCD encoding
#
# divxenc can also send mails if configured to do so. There are four
# variables that need to be set in the mail settings below:
# MAILNOTIFY    # Enable/disable sending mail with y or n
# EMAIL         # The recepient's email address
# MAILSUBJ      # The mail's subject
# MAILMSG       # The actual mail message
#
# There is no need to add date/time to your email message as this is
# being done automatically.
#
# divxenc uses the 'mail' program which reads the mail settings from
# /home/username/.mailrc. If there's no such file present or it is
# configured incorrectly, mail sending will fail. A gmail example
# settings for .mailrc can look like this:
#
# set smtp-use-starttls
# set smtp=smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587
# set smtp-auth=login
# set smtp-auth-user=your-email@gmail.com
# set smtp-auth-password=your-password
